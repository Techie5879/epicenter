# Documentation

This directory contains knowledge articles, guides, and reference materials for Epicenter.

## Start Here

- [Decisions (ADRs)](adr/README.md): the authoritative record of durable architecture decisions and why. Trust this over any spec.
- [Context](CONTEXT.md): shared vocabulary for the platform's concepts.
- [Positioning](positioning.md): canonical public claims and vocabulary rules.
- [Architecture](architecture.md): the repo's main server, app, package, and deployment boundaries.
- [Trust model](trust-model.md): what the trusted relay reads, the two deployments, and where the anchor is heading.
- [Spec history](spec-history.md): a dated index of every spec ever written (history, not current truth).

## Authority and Specs

Durable decisions live in [`adr/`](adr/README.md), shared vocabulary in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), current state in the code and reference docs. These are authoritative.

Specs at `/specs` (repo root) are in-flight scaffolding, not current truth: they plan work that is underway and are deleted once their decision is harvested into an ADR. See the [specs README](/specs/README.md) for the workflow, and [`spec-history.md`](spec-history.md) for the dated index of past specs. When a spec disagrees with an ADR or the code, the ADR and code win.
